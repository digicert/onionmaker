# Onion Maker

onion-maker is a utility to create CSRs for Tor v3 services. The CSRs generated by this utility are suitable for validation of Tor v3 Onion Domain Names according to Appendix B of the CA/Browser Forum Baseline Requirements.

## Quickstart

1. `pip3 install onion-maker`
2. `python -m onion-maker [CA random value] [Tor v3 Ed25519 private key file]`

## Usage

onion-maker requires two command line arguments:

| Argument         | Description                                                                  |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| random_value     | The Random Value supplied the CA. It must be a hex string.                   |
| private_key_file | The file that contains the Ed25119 private key for the Tor v3 Onion service. |

The utility will then create and sign a CSR with the specified private key, outputting the CSR to stdout.
